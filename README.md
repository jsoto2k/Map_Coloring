# Map_Coloring
Map Coloring project in Rust for Artificial Intelligence Class: 

In this project I solved the map coloring problem, which is used to determine the most efficient way to color a map so that that states / countries sharing an edge have different colours

## Method 
In order to solve this I used the minimum remaining value heuristic as well as the concept of the four color theorem, in order to create an approach that solves this in a matter of microseconds.
